The project was made to evaluate the discrete event simulation of Airport Traffic.

The code can be run by opening DESProject.R in RSTudio. 
System specifications in which the code was made are:-
R 3.6.1
i5 8th gen 4.2GHz
8GB LPDDR3 RAM
128GB SSD

Packages required in R are:-
simmer
simmer.plot
ggplot2

DESProject.pdf contains the report of the project containing Introduction, Motivation for choosing the problem, result analysis and conclusion and references.

OUTPUT.png contains the Output generated from the code was 100 repetitions of the simulation.
The time taken for 100 simulations was 1.134027 mins
